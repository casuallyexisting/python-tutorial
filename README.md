# Simple Python Introduction
This project is a basic tutorial to get you started using python! This tutorial project gets COVID-19 statistics from a website, processes the data, and displays the data on a nice graph.
- If you have never used python before, it's recommended that you start from the beginning of the tutorial. This will go over the basics of python such as syntax, variables, functions, etc.
- If you have prior programming experience, I recommend that you learn python syntax from the beginning, but you should be okay skipping the rest of the introduction.
- If you have prior python experience and want an intro to data manipulation with python, or are just looking for a project to do, you are more than welcome to start the tutorial from the COVID-19 project directly, and start learning how to use python for data!

## COVID-19 Python Project
This project has been split up into three parts. Each part will have it's own python file, and the directions for the project are in a markdown file. If you get stuck following the directions on the markdown file, use the python files to see an example.
