# Simple Python Introduction
This project is a basic tutorial to get you started using python! This tutorial project gets COVID-19 statistics from a website, processes the data, and displays the data on a nice graph.
- If you have never used python before, it's reccommended that you start from the beginning of the tutorial. This will go over the basics of python such as syntax, variables, functionsm, etc.
- If you have prior programming experience, you are more than welcome to start the tutorial from the COVID-19 project directly, and start learning how to work with python!

## COVID-19 Python Project
This project has been split up into three parts, with a markdown and python file for each step. Follow along using the markdown instructions, and if you get stuck check the python file for an example. If you would like to see the entire project, a `final.md' file will contain all of the instructions for the project.
